# Project Submission
Here, you can find the project submission for Sensor Fusion Self-Driving Course "Lidar Obstacle Detection Project". In this example, RANSAC, 3D KD-Tree, and Euclidean clustering algorithms are customly modelled according to project rubric. The requirements to be successful in the project are listed below:
- Bounding boxes enclose appropriate objects.
- Objects are consistently detected across frames in the video.
- Segmentation is implemented in the project.
- Clustering is implemented in the project.

You can see the screen recording from the project result:
